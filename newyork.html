                    <p class="NYsub_text">Manhattan in newyork is the borough with the most attractions and hotels in
                        the
                        city. The island of Manhattan is world famous for its skyline filled with the most iconic
                        skyscrapers. It is the beating heart of newyork City; Times Square, Broadway, Wall Street,
                        Empire
                        State Building and Central Park, among others, can be found here. This newyork borough is too
                        big
                        to name everything there is to see and do. Below I mention places that come to my mind when I
                        think
                        of Manhattan.</p>

                    <p class="NYsub_text">The Empire State Building is a 102-story[c] Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown
                        Manhattan, newyork City. The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930
                        to 1931. Its name is derived from "Empire State", the nickname of the state of newyork. The
                        building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m)
                        tall, including its antenna. </p>

                    <h2 class="center">Ithaca</h2>
                    <p class="NYsub_text">Ithaca, on the southern tip of Cayuga Lake, is a college town through and
                        through, but it's also got that rustic, upstate vibe and gorgeous fall foliage you're looking
                        for with quaint Victorian homes to gaze at. It's a great getaway for those who want to go
                        leaf-peeping and pumpkin picking but also want to check out the local town nightlife and its
                        plethora of restaurants. The best part? It's near to some of newyork's most incredible gorges
                        and waterfalls. They don't say "Ithaca is gorges" for nothing.</p>
